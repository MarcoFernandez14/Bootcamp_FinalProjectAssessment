# Bootcamp_FinalProjectAssessment

## Self-Assessment
I think that the project was a great opportunity to go over multiple concepts that we studied during the different bootcamp modules.  
I enjoyed practicing and putting together all the knoledge specially ETL, Database building, ML, etc.
I believe that the Machine Learning section was the most challenging one, however, this is definetly the topic I'd like to keep learning about and practicing.  

## Team Assessment
I think we had a very "mature" team in which all members were always aware of the tasks to be performed in each segment. All the memebers showed themselves available and accountable.
Our team was very well connected and communication flowed uninterruptedly. 
I think we all showed a positive actitude towards the project status in all times and consructive critisism was key to overcome the challenges and improve results.


## Summary of the Project
* Topic: Stray Animals in Sonoma County
The idea was to gather insights about stray animals found in Sonoma County and understand how different factors such as location, weather, etc. can impact the volume of stray animals found in Sonoma County.
We used machine learning to predict outcomes of stray animals found in Sonoma County. We focused in the model GradientBoostingRegresor.
